## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate the efforts of researchers to responsibly disclose any potential issues. If you have discovered a vulnerability in this project, please follow the guidelines below to report it.

### Reporting Process

1. **Step 1**: Submitting the Report
   - Contact us by sending an email to [kahlob@hydratechnologies.us](mailto:kahlob@hydratechnologies.us) with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Include the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, along with any relevant information or tools used.
   - If possible, provide a proof-of-concept or a demonstration of the vulnerability.
   - You can expect an acknowledgment of your report within 24 hours.

2. **Step 2**: Assessment and Validation
   - Our security team will review the vulnerability report and assess its impact and validity.
   - We may request additional information or clarifications from you, if necessary.
   - Please allow us reasonable time to conduct a thorough evaluation of the reported vulnerability.

3. **Step 3**: Fixing and Disclosure
   - Once we have confirmed and validated the vulnerability, we will work towards developing a fix.
   - We strive to address security issues promptly and will keep you updated on the progress.
   - If you would like to be credited for your contribution, please let us know in your initial report.
   - Once the fix is ready, we will release a new version or patch that resolves the vulnerability.

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you adhere to responsible disclosure practices while investigating and reporting vulnerabilities. This includes:

- Not exploiting any vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- Avoiding the use of any automated tools that may cause disruption or degradation of our services.
- Not publicly disclosing the vulnerability before it has been resolved and a fix is released.

We are committed to working with security researchers to understand and resolve any issues promptly. Your contributions to the security of this project are greatly appreciated.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our security policy or the handling of vulnerabilities, please contact us at [kahlob@hydratechnologies.us](mailto:kahlob@hydratechnologies.us).
